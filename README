kloop is a CL-style loop macro for Kawa and R6RS.

Installation
 
  1. Use the Makefile to build kloop.jar
  2. Start Kawa so that kloop.jar is in the classpath
  3. Use (import (kloop)) to import the loop macro

Documentation

  The CLHS describes what the loop macro should do:
    http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/06_.htm

  All features should work as described in the spec with the following
  exceptions:
    - Scheme has no packages so for-as-package is not implemented 
    - this version uses #f in situations where CL uses 'nil  
    - loop-finish does currently not work correctly

  My own code is placed in the public domain.
  The file kloop-r6rs/testing.sls has a BSD-style license but it's not
  included the jar file.
